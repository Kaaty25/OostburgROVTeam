# Oostburg ROV Team Summary
This project was created for the purpose of building and organizing the software that runs the Oostburg Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), a High School Club focused on teaching students about robotics and company management. The robot runs using an Arduino Mega and the Processing computer language. Follow the steps below to understand how the robot is set up.

### Arduino Setup
The Arduino is connected to a laptop via USB connection just like any other Arduino. To allow the cable to travel under the water, a USB-ethernet adapter is used on both ends of an ethernet cable where one is plugged into the computer and the other is connected to the Arduino inside of the dry housing of the robot. When the Arduino is successfully connected, an orange and a green light should light up on the Arduino to indicate power and signal.

Parts required for this connection:
```  1 x Laptop Computer with Arduino Software
  1 x Arduino (any model)
  2 x USB-ethernet adapter
  1 x Ethernet cable
  1 x USB cable
```
  
Laptop -> USB-ethernet adapter -> ethernet cable -> USB-ethernet calbe -> USB cable -> Arduino
